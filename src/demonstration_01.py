Challenge #1:
​
Write a function that retrieves the last n elements from a list.
​
Examples:
- last([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 1) ➞ [5]
- last([4, 3, 9, 9, 7, 6], 3) ➞ [9, 7, 6]
- last([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 7) ➞ "invalid"
- last([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 0) ➞ []
​
Notes:
- Return "invalid" if n exceeds the length of the list.
- Return an empty list if n == 0.
