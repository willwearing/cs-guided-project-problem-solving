Challenge #10:

Given a string of space separated integers, write a function that returns the
maximum and minimum integers.

Example:
- max_and_min("1 2 3 4 5") -> "5 1"
- max_and_min("1 2 -3 4 5") -> "5 -3"
- max_and_min("1 9 3 4 -5") -> "9 -5"

Notes:
- All inputs are valid integers.
- There will always be at least one number in the input string.
- The return string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and
the maximum number is first.

    Input: String of space-seperated numbers
    Output: A string with two space-seperated numbers where the max is first and min is second
    
    We have 'max' and 'min' functions that work on numbers
    We have a variant of a problem where if the input was in a different format, 
    we'd have our solution to the problem

    1. Turn our input string into a list of numbers
    2. Use max and min functions to calc max and min
    3. We now have the max and min integers; format them into the required string format
